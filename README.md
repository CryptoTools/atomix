atomix

The atomic cross trading wallet.

Atomix will someday be able to hold bitcoin, ether, mints, and more currencies. It will allow you to trustlessly exchange pairs of currencies with other users, without depending on any central server.

It depends on pybitcointools for bitcoin. 

To try it out:
python main.py

then point your browser to: http://localhost:8000
